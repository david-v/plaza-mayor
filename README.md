#Plaza Mayor

Web service and personal project intended to:

1. Learn Java, and its tech stack which is new to me.
2. Learn a bit of Python
3. Learn Google Cloud services as infrastructure provider as opposed to AWS
4. Have fun.
5. Perhaps build something I can then use as a web service for an Android app / Angular.js front
6. Get motivated to [next step] learn Android
7. Get motivated to [next-next step] learn Angular!
